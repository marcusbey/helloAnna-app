Success Metrics for Weekend
MVP Must-Haves:
✅ Emma responds to text messages
✅ Community agent reads Gmail and reports to Emma
✅ Emma synthesizes agent reports into user updates
✅ Voice message recording/playback works
✅ User can delegate tasks via Emma to community agent
✅ Basic web interface deployed and accessible
Nice-to-Haves (if time permits):

Twitter integration working
Voice-to-text processing
Mobile-responsive design
Real-time notifications

Emergency Simplifications (if falling behind)

Skip Twitter integration → Focus only on Gmail
Use simpler UI → Basic form instead of chat interface
Mock voice processing → Just store voice files, process later
Local deployment only → Skip cloud deployment
Hardcode responses → Use templates instead of full AI generation
